SquareCubed InDev 0.3.0
=======================
SquareCubed is a 2D OpenGL Multiplayer game engine written
in C++. Designed for both quick prototyping and full release
games, SquareCubed aims to create an extensive diverse and
extensible toolkit for creating 2D multiplayer games.

The engine is open source to allow people to freely
contribute to the development of this project and to allow
people to use the engine in their own software projects.
